data from XDG_DATA_HOME -- both times in the ygopro subdirectory --
defaulting to the installation path for files that are not found there while
still respecting YGOPRO_*_PATH as before.
Please move your configuration to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ygopro and your decks,
replays, and other data to $XDG_DATA_HOME/ygopro.  If those variables are not
set, use the default ~/.config and ~/.local/share respectively.")))
