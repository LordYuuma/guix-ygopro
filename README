#+TITLE: Guix channel for YGOPro

This channel contains various packages associated in some way with the
card game simulation engine YGOPro, including various script cores,
scripts, databases, images, and of course the games themselves ;)

* Available packages
** Cores
- ~ygopro-core~
- ~edopro-core~
** Games
- ~ygopro~
- ~edopro~
** Databases
- ~ygopro-database-en~
- ~ygopro-database-ja~
- ~ygopro-database-zh~
- ~edopro-database~ (outdated in comparison, but contains scripts compatible to ~edopro~)
** Images
- ~ygopro-images-field~
- ~ygopro-images-en~
- ~ygopro-images-ja~
- ~ygopro-images-zh~
* Patches
The cores and games are patched moderately to heavily in order to make them
build and run "as expected".
** Unbundling
The cores and the Lua library are unbundled from the main sources, with the
latter being pulled separately from Guix upstream.
** Additional PATH variables
The games read the following paths
- ~YGOPRO_IMAGE_PATH~ :: Path in which images are to be found.
- ~YGOPRO_SCRIPT_PATH~ :: Path in which scripts are to be found.
- ~YGOPRO_DATA_PATH~ :: Path in which databases, strings and
     Forbidden/Limited lists are to be found.
