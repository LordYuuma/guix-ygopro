#+TITLE: Guix channel for YGOPro

This channel contains various packages associated in some way with the
card game simulation engine YGOPro, including various script cores,
scripts, databases, images, and of course the games themselves ;)

* Available packages
** Cores
- ~ygopro-core~
- ~edopro-core~
** Games
- ~ygopro~
- ~edopro~
** Databases
- ~ygopro-database-en~
- ~ygopro-database-ja~
- ~ygopro-database-zh~
- ~ignis-database~ (for ~edopro~)
** Scripts
- ~ygopro-scripts~
- ~ignis-scripts~
** Images
- ~ygopro-images-en~
- ~ygopro-images-ja~
- ~ygopro-images-zh~
* Patches
The cores and games are patched moderately to heavily in order to make them
build and run "as expected".
** Unbundling
The cores and the Lua library are unbundled from the main sources, with the
latter being pulled separately from Guix upstream.
** Additional PATH variables
The games read the following paths:
- ~YGOPRO_IMAGE_PATH~ :: Path in which images are to be found.
- ~YGOPRO_SCRIPT_PATH~ :: Path in which scripts are to be found.
- ~YGOPRO_DATA_PATH~ :: Path in which databases, strings and
     Forbidden/Limited lists are to be found.

The games also read their configuration from ~$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ygopro~ and their data from ~$XDG_DATA_HOME/ygopro~ instead of the working directory as they would normally.

* Compatibility
By design ~edopro~ is largely incompatible to ~ygopro~, but we use the same config and data directories for both.  This allows configuration and data to be shared (to some extent), but can also cause some issues (e.g. settings set by ~edopro~ being removed by ~ygopro~).

If you are worried about your configurations, you can either use backups or temporarily set ~HOME~ (or just ~XDG_CONFIG_HOME~) to some other value, e.g. ~/homeless-shelter~.

Some data, such as decks and textures, can be shared without problems.  Others, like puzzles and replays, may work in one, but not the other.
